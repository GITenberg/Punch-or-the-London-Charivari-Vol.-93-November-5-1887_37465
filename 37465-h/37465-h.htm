<p class="right"><i>Liverpool, Saturday Noon.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Toby</span>,</p>

<p>My boat is on the shore,
And my bark is on the sea,
But before I go, <span class="sc">To-bee</span>,
I will write a line to thee.
I am here to join the bark
aforesaid, which will presently
convey <span class="sc">Joseph</span> and
his fortunes to the United
States. As far as one can
judge from the Press news
telegraphed here, the reception
that awaits me is
not very cordial. I have
all my life been conscious
of a tendency to rub people
down the wrong way.
Unhappily the consciousness
is borne in upon me
only after the evil is effected. No succession of experience has effect
upon my conduct. <span class="sc">Hartington</span> and I are pretty good friends now,
but I daresay you will remember the night, now a dozen years dead,
when I rose from a seat below the Gangway in the House of Commons
and, amid frantic cheers from the little Radical Party of which I was
then a humble ornament, denounced him as "<i>late</i> the Leader of the
Liberal Party." The Markiss is now my friend and ally, and I might
almost say patron. The time is too short for me to recall a tithe of
the nasty things I have said about him and others who toil not,
neither do they spin. With <span class="sc">Gladstone</span> the process is reversed, but
in the end is much the same. I began by adulating him, and now
no one can say that that is my precise attitude towards him.</p>

<p>It is more or less well as far as individuals are concerned. But I
am afraid I put my foot in it when, in defiance of historic warning,
I framed an indictment against a whole nation. Going out to the
New World on a mission of peace, I began by aggravating Canada
and setting up the back of the United States. When I reflect how
easy it would have been for me to say nothing, I stand amazed at
my own indiscretion. The only recompense I find in the situation is
the chagrin of the Markiss and his friends. They thought they had
done a nice stroke of policy in engaging me on this business. It is,
of course, not a new procedure. If I were still on the other side, I
should take delight in showing that herein, as in the matter of the
Convention with France just completed, they have taken a leaf out of
the book of their political opponents, and re-issued it with their own
imprimatur. The last time a Commissioner was sent out from England
to reason with the United States, <span class="sc">Gladstone</span> was in the Markiss's
place, and he selected <span class="sc">Stafford Northcote</span> as the agent. It was an
excellent device, tying in advance the hands of the enemy, who could
scarcely denounce a policy for the initiation and direction of which one
of their principal men was chiefly responsible. But what a difference
between <span class="sc">Stafford Northcote</span> and me!&mdash;a difference which the
Markiss is already beginning to realise. The proposal suited me
well enough. It would take me away from the country at a time
when my presence here only involves me in embarrassing controversy.
Moreover, if I made a great hit, and insured a successful
Treaty, it would pave the way for my return to my old position in
the popular esteem. As for the Markiss, my acceptance of the work
would secure for him an ally on the Opposition benches in the event
of future debate arising out of the Treaty, and would draw into
close, personal union with his Party what only natural modesty prevents
me from alluding to as a formidable antagonist. That was the
little game; and for the sake of saying something bitter, under the
temptation to gird at an adversary that had affronted me, I hopelessly
spoiled it.</p>

<p>Writing to you, <i>cher</i> <span class="sc">Toby</span>, in the confidence of friendly correspondence
(I suppose your letters are not opened at the Post Office,
Barkshire not being an Irish county) I will confess that I really
could not help it. It is not that I do not know better, but my
temper is perhaps a little peculiar. I am essentially a fighting-man.
If any one bites his thumb at me I will know the reason why, and
no considerations of what is politic will prevent me from returning
a blow. I know that some people think I'm almost to be pitied
because (as they put it) I have hopelessly thrown away a position
which no one but myself could have destroyed. They think I am
politically done for. We shall see. However it be, I shall not forget
the wild joy of battle that the events of the past year have purchased
for me. I like it best with my back to the wall in the House of
Commons, when my old friends jeer and howl at me, and the rapturous
cheers of the Conservatives testify their pleasure at seeing me
of all men playing their game&mdash;as they think. I confess things at
the moment are not from any point of view very bright. But I can
afford to wait, strong in the assurance that I can do better without
the Liberal Party than the Liberal Party can do without me. They
call me a Dissentient, which reminds me of a story I once heard
about an aboriginal resident in the great country whither I am now
hastening. A red man was found wandering in the depths of the
forest with signs of perturbation manifest beneath his manfully
calm exterior. "Are you lost?" he was asked. "No," he answered,
"me no lost. Me here. Wigwam lost." It is not I that am a
Dissentient Liberal; it is the Liberal Party that is the Dissentient.</p>

<p>Now here is the Mayor come to say that luncheon's ready, and so,
dropping into poetry again, I will say good-bye, With a sigh to those
who love me, And a smile to those who hate, And, whatever sky's
above me, Here's a heart for every fate. Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">J. Ch-mb-rl-n</span>.</p>

<h2>BOUNTIES TO FOREIGNERS.</h2>

<p><i>First Passenger (in Underground Railway).</i> We're such a frightfully
<i>insular</i> nation! Ignorant, exclusive, say-nothing-to-nobody
sort of people! Think there's nothing beyond Straits of Dover&mdash;or
Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p><i>Second Ditto (agreeing out of politeness).</i> Horrible? By the bye,
that's a nice picture of the Paris Hippodrome, isn't it?</p>

<p><i>First Passenger (indifferently).</i> Is it? But, as I was saying,
insularity is our&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Second Ditto (startled).</i> Hullo! By Jove!&mdash;no, it can't be true!
Yes, it is&mdash;here's an English newspaper taken to giving a column, a
whole column, of French news <i>in French!</i> (<i>Humorously.</i>) Very
insular, isn't it?</p>

<p><i>First Passenger (not understanding the point).</i> Very. And, as I
was saying, it's our besetting sin. We hide our heads like ostriches,
and refuse to recognise the existence of foreigners. Then what does
this insularity mean? It means we're <i>isolated</i>&mdash;cut off from Europe&mdash;hated
by everybody.</p>

<p><i>Second Ditto (roused at last).</i> I don't know what you call being
insular and isolated. French Plays are on at a London Theatre. An
Italian Exhibition's coming to Earl's Court. We get our music from
Germany, our singers from Italy, and our butter and eggs from
Belgium and Brittany; and, on the whole, don't you think London's
about the most Cosmopolitan Capital to be found anywhere? Ah,
here's my Station. Good morning!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Magazines in Bulk.</span>&mdash;It is as impossible to "sample" a magazine
by a monthly number as it is to estimate the quality of a wine by the
glass. If you take a bottle you know something about it. Thus
when we see the <i>English Illustrated</i> in volume we are fully able to
estimate its worth. The present volume is in every way equal to its
predecessors. Volume Fourteen of <i>St. Nicholas</i> is one of those good
gifts that Brother <span class="sc">Jonathan</span> sends us. It is a delightful collection
of child-poems, child-pictures, and child-lore. The editor, Miss
<span class="sc">Mary Mapes Dodge</span> knows full well how difficult it is to please
those keen critics, the children, but she has "dodged" it.</p>

<h2>ROBERT ON LUXURY.</h2>

<p>Alderman Sir <span class="sc">Renery Knight</span>, late Lord Mare, and one of the werry best
as we ever had, and so was his good wife, the Lady Maress, hapening for to
be a setting at the Manshun House when the <span class="sc">Lord Mare</span> was gorn out for a ride
somewheres, had to receive what I thinks is called a Deputytashun&mdash;though not
a bit like reel Deputys, who is all werry rich&mdash;of poor working-men as ain't got
not no work to do, and, like the kind gennelman as he is, he gave 'em sum such
capital adwice as to the utter stoopidity of making theirselves noisy and disagreeable
when they wants to make people kindly dispoged towards 'em, and
as to the well-known fackt, that the best friends of the working-classes is them
as spends their money the most freest and the most liberalist, that he set the
hole City a ringing with it, and as always happens alike in exacly similar cases,
up starts a mere upstart of a Pollytickle Economist&mdash;how I hates the werry
sound of that larst word, which is ony another name for stingyness and
meanness and sham forgitfulness of the pore Waiter&mdash;and says as it ain't true!
Like his imperance I think, but of coarse ewery body has a right to his own
opinion, however ridicklus it may be. But being a Lecturer, and therefore I
spose acustomed to use his tung pretty freely, he mite have been xpected to
have kept a civil one in his head when he rote his reply to Sir <span class="sc">Renery</span>. Instead
of which he fust calls him incorrygible, which I beleeve means that he carnt be
conwicted, as if a Alderman and Magistrate could be! He then writes of his
"Colossal ignorance!" I don't quite know what it means but I'm quite sure
that however small the Alderman's may be, the Lecturer's is ever so much
bigger, as I'll prove from my own pussonal knowledge.</p>

<p>He acshally has the ordassity to adwise the Rite Honerable the <span class="sc">Lord Mare</span>
not to employ so many cooks! Poor hignoramus! has he ever dined at the
Manshun House on a trewly grate ocashun? Most suttenly not, or he never
would have written such a silly, not to say cruel sentence. Not so many cooks
indeed! Does he think that the Chef who has given his whole mind to the
preparing of the Thick and Clear Turtle, is not so utterly xhausted that he has
to drink two or three glasses of werry old Madeary, and
then lay down on his sophy and recover hisself by slow
degrees. Does he think that the Fish Cooks, with praps
six differing kinds of Fish to prepare, is fit for anything
else? and how about the Sauce Artists, let him try to
emagine, tho' he'll try in wain, what they has to go
through in the tasting line. Then there are the French
gentlemen who superintend the production of those
wunders in what they calls the guestronommick line,
wiz.: the <i>Ontrays!</i> Is it supposed by this "curlossal"
hignoramus, that they can, after achieving brilliant
success in these wunders of hart, condescend to turn
their attention to such werry small deer as poultry and
jints? Suttenly not, the thing's absurd. But they
requires cooks, tho' of coarse, not of the same hi horder
as the Hartists.</p>

<p>But, strange to tell, ewen this is not the wust. Not
only is the <span class="sc">Lord Mare</span> adwised not to employ so many
Cooks, but the trewly wunderful reason is given, becoz
he can then employ more railway navvies! Shades of
<span class="sc">Frank Hurtelly</span> and <span class="sc">Swoyhay</span>, rest tranquil in your
long graves!</p>

<p>But what a dedly hinsult to one of the werry noblest
of all noble perfessions, to compare for usefulness a mere
railway navvy to a great Chef. Is this strange economist
aware that the great Earl of <span class="sc">Sefton</span>, prais to his
memory! used to allow his Chef £300 a year and a Horse
and Broom for the Park! But all sitch conclusive arguments
is I fear utterly lost upon him.</p>

<p>However, there is just one matter for which I have to
thank him. I confess that my face werry possibly turned
gashly pale as I read his orful letter, I fornatrally thort
if he is going to recommend less Cooks he may werry
posserbly be a going for to recommend less Waiters!
But no, he had the good taste to draw his line there, and
for that I thanks him. What a treat it is to turn from
the wild projecks of the Lecterer to the wise counsels
of the Alderman. No doubt, he says, we could all do
without luxuries, but what would become of the millions
who produces them? No doubt, he says, we could all
live on plain food and drink water&mdash;what orful words for
a Alderman to write down!&mdash;but then what would become
of the millions who earns their living in preparing
them, and he might have added, as a clencher to his
staggering argument, and what would become of Hus?
If there is one picter that presents itself to my orrified
imagination, that more than any other staggers it, it is
that of the hole splendid Army of London Waiters, with
their full dress black coats a gitting jist a leetle shabby,
and their lovely white chokers jest a leetle shady, a
parading the London Streets, and a singing in Chorus,
"We've got no work to do!" But no, I feels as that
orful dream will never live to be realised, but, to use the
classic langwidge as the Lecturer quotes from some frend
of his, and which I supposes as he intends as a complement,
"let the idol rich still take their proper place as
drones in the hive, gorging at a feast to which they have
contributed nothing," and he might have added, and
never never forgetting the Waiter.</p>

<h2>SHOWS VIEWS.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width:18%;">
<a href="images/208-1.png">
<img width="100%" src="images/208-1.png" alt="M. Coquelin" />
</a>
</div>

<p>M. <span class="sc">Coquelin</span> is at the Royalty with an efficient French Company
appearing in a round of his best-known characters. He has already
taken part in <i>Un Parisien, Don Cæsar
de Bazan</i> and an entirely new piece
(first time in London and elsewhere)
<i>L'Aîné</i>. This last I had the pleasure
of seeing the other evening, and was
delighted to find that it was a play
that could be safely recommended as
a fit entertainment for their charge to
the guardians of that apparently very
easily-influenced infant, "The Young
Person." It is rather suggestive of
several English original pieces, amongst
the rest <i>Miriam's Crime</i> and <i>Faded
Flowers</i>. The adopted daughter
(rescued as a child from the gutter) of
a millionnaire, after her protector's
death, undertakes the reformation of
her benefactor's brother, who takes,
through intestacy, the whole of his
senior's estate. To carry this out
effectively, the young lady prevents
the heir from drinking his <i>chasse</i> after his coffee, and playing a
game of <i>écarté</i> with an old friend, for love, and finally offers to
marry him. The heir is as quiet as a lamb under these inflictions,
until he discovers that his <i>fiancée</i> loves some one else, when he
proposes, at the earliest possible moment, to commit suicide. This
inconvenient intention is prevented, the adopted daughter marries
the man of her choice, and the heir goes back to America, thus all
ends happily. <span class="sc">Coquelin</span>, as the heir, was seen to very great advantage
in the less sentimental parts of the character, but was not
quite so successful when he commenced crying over the
portrait of <i>L'Aîné</i>, which, by the way, was a very excellent
likeness (without the eyeglass) of the Right Hon. <span class="sc">Joseph
Chamberlain</span>. For the rest Madame <span class="sc">Malvau</span> was rather a mature
adopted daughter, M. <span class="sc">Romain</span> (as "<i>Georges</i>&mdash;her friend") a little too
heavy in more senses than one as the superfluous lover, and M.
<span class="sc">Duquesne</span> a very excellent lawyer. There is nothing particularly
brilliant in the writing, and only one line raises a laugh. When
the vagabond friend of the heir extends his hand, <i>M. Vivien</i>,
without a movement, merely asks, "<i>Combien?</i>" But on its
repetition this admirable joke did not "go" quite so well.
Still there is a freshness in the central idea of the play
which is welcome. As a rule every one on the French stage
weeps over somebody's mother, but in this case the tears were reserved
for somebody's brother. It is said that the Author of the piece,
M. <span class="sc">Paul Delair</span>, is a novice at stage-craft. This seems to me very
likely, as had he had more experience, I fancy he would have
allowed (especially if he had known that the character was going to
be played by M. <span class="sc">Romain</span>) <i>M. Georges</i> to have been shot dead in the
First Act. This would have been really a great improvement,
especially had <i>Yveline</i> (the adopted daughter) been allowed to expire
from grief early in the Second. Joking apart, <i>L'Aîné</i> is not half a
bad piece, although I cannot conscientiously go so far as to say that
it is half a good one. Before the engagement of M. <span class="sc">Coquelin</span> is over,

<p>The Paris Hippodrome has once more taken possession of Olympia,
where it seems likely to remain until well into next year. The entertainment
is of the customary quality, which is saying a great deal in
its praise. There are excellent <i>troupes</i> of acrobats and performing
dogs (with a wonderful black poodle that
is the best clown that has appeared in a
Circus for many a long year), chariot-races,
and horsemanship in all its
branches. This season the Ladies have
it all their own way. The last time M.
<span class="sc">Houcke</span> visited us, Gentlemen drove the
team of thirty-two, and jumped over the
hurdles with the tandem of three; now
their places are supplied by members of
the fairer sex. The horses who take part
in these feats are so admirably trained
that the element of danger is entirely
eliminated, and, consequently, the change is an improvement. Then
an accomplished cob and an elegant elephant take a turn together
in more senses than one, for they dance <i>vis-à-vis</i> a waltz and
a polka. The novelty of the Show, however, is kept for the
second part, and is apparently a page from the Algerian experiences
of General <span class="sc">Boulanger</span>. The attention of a tribe of Arabs
(seemingly on their road to church) having been attracted to a
military train containing a bugle-band of Turcos and some half-dozen
soldiers of the French line, devotions are temporarily abandoned
for a pitched battle. The Arabs fire upon the Europeans, who, however,
after a lively skirmish, succeed in "taking up a position" with
the bugle-band, and then retire. The Arabs bearing no ill-will,
dancing follows, and the fighting being quite over and forgotten,
General <span class="sc">Boulanger</span>, accompanied by a Staff, swaggers in and assists
at further military exercises. Then the bugle-band heads the procession
of French and Arabs, and, after marching past <span class="sc">Boulanger</span>,
<i>exeunt</i>. The attack upon the train, if a little perplexing from a
purely historical point of view, is capitally managed, and very
exciting. Since the opening night the large hall has been very well
attended; and now that the American Exhibition is closed, may be
expected to be crowded&mdash;and a crowded audience at the Addison
Road cannot be recorded in less than five figures. "The Wild West
is gone&mdash;long live Olympia!"</p>

<p>A second visit to the Royal Westminster Aquarium has not improved
my opinion of "the Wolves, the Wolves, the Wolves!" (see
Advertisement) as a pleasure-insuring entertainment. I have already
said that the tricks of these animals cause a "creepy" sensation,
and when I made this observation I referred to the "kissing act,"
wherein a wolf embraces the portly person in the Polish lancer's
uniform who has trained it. But the fights between master and brutes
are even less tolerable, as may be judged to be the case when I say
that, on a recent occasion when I was present, the trainer seemed to
be a good-half-hour (no doubt it was an infinitely less period of
time) in getting one of his wild beasts into its allotted cage. It is
not at all a nice sight to see a man beating a snapping and yelping
wolf with a whip, for one feels that there is the element of cruelty
on both sides. Take it allround, I prefer "the <i>belle</i> <span class="sc">Fatma</span>,"&mdash;that
is, taking her all round, on which I need hardly say I should not
venture,&mdash;to "the Wolves, the Wolves, the Wolves!" And I sincerely
hope that <span class="sc">Fatma</span> (the old lady near her looks more like Fat Ma) may
always be able to keep the wolf from her door.</p>

To your second question, as to whether I approve of the conduct of

<p>I trust I have quoted with textual accuracy your so charming, and
to the actual situation happily appropriate poet?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bull (avec empressement).</i> It does&mdash;or perhaps I should say
doth&mdash;indeed, Madam. As to the bit from the bard&mdash;well, may its
appropriateness never be less! How much pleasanter than the grim
dictum of an elder rhymester, who referred to your people as those</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Whom nature hath predestined for our foes,</p>
<p>And made it bliss and virtue to oppose."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p><i>Madame France.</i> The barbarian! Oppose, indeed! Why should
we oppose each other, dear Monsieur <span class="sc">Bull</span>?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bull.</i> Why, indeed?</p>

<p><i>Madame France.</i> True, your bellicose Lord <span class="sc">Palmerston</span> did
oppose my great <span class="sc">Ferdinand's</span> grand idea, and that from motives the
most insular and unenlightened. Just as some few poltroons in your
sea-girt isle at present oppose the Channel Tunnel, which yet, in
good time, will doubtless become as benign an actuality as the Suez
Canal itself.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bull.</i> Humph! <span class="sc">Pam</span> had perhaps his reasons, which, in the
light of subsequent events, one must admit not to have been without
their weight.</p>

<p><i>Madame France.</i> Oh, Monsieur <span class="sc">Bull</span>! "Greater freedom of
intercourse between nations is the tendency of our industrial and
social development, and the tide of human intelligence cannot be
arrested by <i>vague fears</i>." So I read in a pamphlet on the Tunnel.
How true, is it not?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bull.</i> Doubtless; as true as that the tide of invasion could not
be arrested by cosmopolitan cant.</p>

<p><i>Madame France.</i> Invasion? Fie, Monsieur <span class="sc">Bull</span>! In the new
lexicon of international amity there is no such word.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bull.</i> If the excision of the <i>word</i> could absolutely abolish the
possibility of the thing, all would be well&mdash;between you and Germany,
for instance.</p>

<p><i>Madame France.</i> <i>Sacre-e-e!</i> I beg pardon. Expletives should
also be banished from civility's lexicon. But <span class="sc">Bismarck</span> is a <i>monstre</i>,
a <i>miserable</i>,&mdash;whereas you&mdash;&mdash;! <span class="stage">[<i>Bows sweetly.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Bull.</i> Inarticulate flattery, Madam, is irresistible&mdash;and unanswerable.
The renewal&mdash;if, indeed, it was ever <i>really</i> interrupted&mdash;of
the <i>entente cordiale</i> between us, is a blessed boon not to be matched
in value by a hundred&mdash;Tunnels!</p>

<p><i>Madame France.</i> And this Convention is the sign and seal of that
renewal, <i>n'est-ce-pas</i>? I <i>knew</i> you never intended to stop in Egypt.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bull.</i> Longer than was necessary&mdash;assuredly not, Madam.
And I was <i>certain</i> the New Hebrides had no real charms to permanently
arrest your feet.</p>

<p><i>Madame France.</i> Though a <i>pied à terre</i> in Raraitea, of course&mdash;you
comprehend, Monsieur!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bull.</i> Perfectly. The questions of Egypt and the New
Hebrides, of our post near the Pyramids, and your Protectorate
near Tahiti, have, of course, no real connection.</p>

<p><i>Madame France.</i> Obviously, Monsieur! Are they not dealt with
in separate Conventions?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bull.</i> Ah! if all quarrels&mdash;I beg pardon, political problems&mdash;could
as easily be settled by a Conventional Act!</p>

<p><i>Madame France.</i> How welcome to you, Monsieur, to all parties in
your Parliament, to the "rescuers" as to the "retirers," to your
Lord <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>, as well as to your Grand Old <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>, must be
the prospect of an early, not to say immediate withdrawal from the
Land of the Pharaohs! Surely the fugitive Israelites of old never
left it with such pleased promptitude as <i>you</i> will&mdash;"scuttle out" of
it! Have I accurate memory of the Beaconsfieldian phrase,
Monsieur?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bull.</i> Your memory, Madam, is miraculous. The forty centuries&mdash;<i>or,
however, many more there may happen to be there at the
moment of my departure</i>&mdash;will doubtless, in the words of your own
great phraser, "look down from the Pyramids" with emotions not
less marked than my own&mdash;and yours, Madam.</p>

<p><i>Madame France.</i> My emotions at the present moment&mdash;and yours,
I hope, Monsieur&mdash;are simply of supreme joy at the so happy removal
of difficulties and the so complete restoration of amity between us by
this charming Convention, so satisfactory in its actual terms, so
much more so <i>in its promises for the future</i>. I felicitate you, dear
Monsieur <span class="sc">Bull</span>.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>"<i>My Autobiography and Reminiscences</i>," by <span class="sc">W. P. Frith</span>,
R.A. The Modern Hogarth, painter of "<i>Ramsgate Sands</i>," "<i>The
Derby Day</i>," and "<i>The Road to Ruin</i>," can use his pen as well as
his pencil. "Where got thou that goose-quill?" as <i>Macbeth</i> would
have said, had <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span> wished him to do so. How is it that
Mr. <span class="sc">Frith</span> has never employed his goose-quill before? Sometimes
it is soft-nibbed, and occasionally hard-nibbed, but it is almost
always well pointed; and, though he writes with an overflowing
pen&mdash;for he frequently has to check his impulsive waywardness&mdash;yet
there is scarcely a blot on the paper throughout the two volumes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Frith</span> is, first and foremost, a humorist, and, in his humour, so
like <span class="sc">Thackeray</span>, and so unlike <span class="sc">Dickens</span>, that it is no wonder, considering
the consistent inconsistency of human nature, he should have
loved the latter, and disliked the former. Yet, with all his aversion
to <span class="sc">Thackeray</span>, personally&mdash;and "all his works" too, apparently,
as he hardly mentions them&mdash;he records something very remarkable
about the Satirist of the Snobs which could not be guessed at from
<span class="sc">Thackeray's</span> own letters, nor from the anecdotes told about him.
And it is this; that <span class="sc">Thackeray</span> could make, and on occasion did
make an excellent after-dinner speech. At the Macready banquet
with <span class="sc">Bulwer Lytton</span> and <span class="sc">Dickens</span> present, Mr. <span class="sc">Frith</span> tells us,
"<span class="sc">Thackeray</span> also spoke well and very humorously." And there are
three other instances; so that <span class="sc">Thackeray</span>, who has recounted his
own failure at the Literary Fund dinner, and whose utter collapse at
the Cornhill Magazine dinner is a matter of Literary history, was
not always a mistake as an after-dinner speaker. The modesty
exhibited by Mr. <span class="sc">Frith</span> in this autobiography is an exhibition as
novel and attractive as was <span class="sc">Frith's</span> other exhibition in Bond Street,&mdash;because
few autobiographers possess so keen a sense of humour
as to be able to laugh at themselves, and to be candid about their
own foibles and follies. Indeed some persons may think, and indeed
he inclines to this opinion himself, that he goes too far in his
frankness when narrating the practical jokes of that unscrupulous
and cruel <i>farçeur</i> <span class="sc">Sothern</span> the actor, in some of which the
autobiographer appears to have played a small, but not altogether
unimportant part. In his way Mr. <span class="sc">Frith</span> is as frank and open in
his revelations as to his past career, as was Cardinal <span class="sc">Newman</span> in his
straightforward <i>Apologia pro suâ vitâ</i>. In fact in these <span class="sc">Sothern</span>
latitudes&mdash;there was a great deal of latitude in that quarter&mdash;Mr.
<span class="sc">Frith's</span> work is suggestive less of an autobiography than of a
naughty-biography. He owns that he feels "humiliated and pained"
at recounting <span class="sc">Thackeray's</span> rude jocularity towards himself, and
from the apologetic tone with which he introduces some of <span class="sc">Sothern's</span>
caddish practical jokes, in which Mr. <span class="sc">Frith</span> had no share, and of
which he was not the victim, it may be inferred that he had already
begun to feel "humiliated and pained" at having given so much
space to such stories. How glad he must now be that he kept a
"dear Diary," which has been an invaluable aid to his memory.</p>

<p>Another great merit in the book is that, without ever sacrificing
its character as an Autobiography, it is never egotistical; egoism
being the great "I-sore" of such works. Should the humble individual
who writes this necessarily brief notice ever arrive at the
time for publishing his Recollections, he is perfectly sure that the
book will be unequalled as a work of imagination. Mr. <span class="sc">Frith</span> tells
us how he improved his pictures by touching them up,&mdash;some
people, too, are occasionally improved by the same process, if the
"touching up" is only done judiciously,&mdash;and his self-restraint is
therefore really admirable when he rejects the temptation to embellish,
or spice, a story which no one is likely to contradict. For
instance, in what may be called the Sass-age portion of his early life,
he has some amusing anecdotes about Mr. <span class="sc">Jacob Bell</span>, then an Art
student. <span class="sc">Bell</span> drew a man hanging, and <span class="sc">Sass</span>, the master, told him
to leave the studio, "as such a career," as the man hanging, "is a
bad example to your fellow-pupils." Now Mr. <span class="sc">Frith</span> ought to have
given <span class="sc">Bell</span> a triumphant exit speech&mdash;he ought to have said to <span class="sc">Sass</span>,
"Sir, I was only illustrating what should be the fate of every one of
your successful pupils&mdash;<i>to be hung on the line</i>. Good day." Exit
<span class="sc">Bell</span>. Then he recounts how <span class="sc">Jacob Bell</span>, who, like <span class="sc">Sothern</span>, had
a taste for such practical jokes as are utterly indefensible on the
score of good taste and gentlemanly feeling, dressed up as a woman,
and went to a Quakers' Meeting House, where he sat among the
female portion of the congregation. Thinking he was discovered,
this nice young man "took fright," and bolted. Here Mr. <span class="sc">Frith</span>
should have made the jovial <span class="sc">Jacob</span> subsequently explain that "he
left because the women were all jealous of him, as he was the only
'<span class="sc">Bell</span>' among them." Mr. <span class="sc">Frith</span>, full of his fun, jests, and humour,
must be congratulated on having stuck to the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.</p>

<p>And if anyone wants a first-rate ghost-story for the coming Christmas
time, let him get Mr. <span class="sc">Frith's</span> book, and read how the prosaic
and sensible Mr. <span class="sc">Westwood</span> saw a ghost. It is simply but exquisitely
told, and were it not that Mr. <span class="sc">Frith</span> had previously owned to
his complicity with <span class="sc">Sothern</span> in some of his "spiritualistic"
demonstrations, there would be no sort of ground for suspecting
him capable of joking on such serious subjects. The book is full
of good stories, among which <i>The Mysterious Sitter</i> and <i>Beckford
at Fonthill</i> are about the best. There is already a rail round
<span class="sc">Mudie's</span> counter, and in front of all <span class="sc">Smith's</span> stalls, to keep off the
crowds from taking away <span class="sc">Frith's</span> latest production without paying.
Many of us are eye-witnesses to the fact of the rails in front of
<span class="sc">Smith's</span> bookstalls all the way down the line wherever a train
runs. Mr. <span class="sc">Frith's</span> very good health, and, as his friend <i>Rip-Van-Winkle</i>
<span class="sc">Jefferson</span> used to say, "May he live long an' prosber."</p>

<p><i>De Omnibus Rebus</i>, by the author of <i>Flemish Interiors</i>. An odd
book to be taken up at odd times. Amusing and chatty with a good
deal of shrewd observation. He who rides may read; and as it is
published by <span class="sc">Nimmo</span>, this firm in this instance might adopt the old
Latin motto, "<i>'Nimmo' mortalium omnibus horis sapit</i>;" <i>i.e.</i>
"<span class="sc">Nimmo</span> is wise to bring out a book for the omnibus hours of
mortals."</p>

<p>Madame <span class="sc">Patti's</span> house, in some unpronounceable Welsh place, was
broken into by burglars. We hope they didn't rob her of any notes.
The thieves came from Town&mdash;they were

"Taffy's not a thief."

<p>And it wasn't Taffy who went to <span class="sc">Patti's</span>

worth of French francs. They found a
box of M. <span class="sc">Nicolini's</span> cigars. But the
thieves knew where to draw the line,
and chucked the lot away in the garden,
among the other weeds. They were "up
to snuff," but not to tobacco in this
form. Query, will M. <span class="sc">Nicolini's</span> friends be delighted to accept
cigars from his case in future?</p>

<p>Fortune comes in curious shape.</p>
<p>You perchance, oh simian child!</p>
<p>Might have roamed the Afric wild,</p>
<p>Like a nigger unreclaimed.</p>
<p>Unobserved, unknown, unnamed,</p>

<p>Not of notoriety.</p>
<p>Now!&mdash;Ah, infantine Gorilla,</p>
<p>Every small suburban villa</p>
<p>With your rising fame will ring;</p>
<p>All the sort of folk who bring</p>

<h2>THE FOUR NOBLE BURGLARS.</h2>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>A Baron, a Marquis, a Duke, and an Earl</p>
<p class="i2">Were dining together one evening at White's;</p>
<p>They were all overdone by the worry and whirl</p>
<p class="i2">Of a long London season's amusements and sights&mdash;</p>
<p>By the luncheons that stupify, dinners that tire,</p>
<p class="i2">Dull rides in the Row, deadly five o'clock teas,</p>
<p>At which fashion condemns you to gasp and perspire</p>
<p class="i2">While draining the cup of <i>ennui</i> to the lees.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>No pleasure they took in the joys of the table;</p>
<p class="i2">Though stalwart, they recked not to breakfast or sup&mdash;</p>
<p>E'en to plunge at <i>bézique</i> they no longer were able,</p>
<p class="i2">For the fact was these nobles were deuced hard up!</p>
<p>Moaned the Marquis, "We're all in a state of depression;</p>
<p class="i2">As for me, my existence is simply a bore;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Then the Baron cried, "Listen, old chappies; I've hit</p>
<p class="i2">On a notion that's brilliant and perfectly new;&mdash;</p>
<p>Why shouldn't we four try to burgle a bit,</p>
<p class="i2">And wrest from the wealthy what's fairly our due?</p>
<p>Garotting is vulgar, and cruel to boot,</p>
<p class="i2">The pickpocket oft is despised when detected;</p>
<p>But burglary's just the profession to suit</p>
<p class="i2">A lover of enterprise, highly connected."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>A paper was fetched, and his Grace read aloud</p>
<p class="i2">The following paragraph:&mdash;"Criminal Tips!</p>
<p>Young Nobles and Gentlemen under a cloud</p>

<p class="i2">Where he nightly gives lessons, from seven till nine,</p>
<p>To youngsters of spirit, from prejudice free,</p>
<p class="i2">In arts which amusement with profit combine."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Next evening the Peers, fully dressed for their parts</p>
<p class="i2">In moleskin and highlows and flat beaver-caps,</p>
<p>Sought out the Professor with quick-throbbing hearts,</p>
<p class="i2">Their courage all but in a state of collapse.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Fipps</span> gave them seats; then politely inquired,</p>
<p class="i2">If aught to oblige them perchance he could do,</p>
<p>And replied, when they told him what 'twas they required,</p>
<p class="i2">"All right, noble sportsmen!&mdash;I'll soon put you through!"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>He taught them to handle the jemmy with grace,</p>
<p class="i2">To frisk with the centrebit, toy with the file&mdash;</p>
<p>To flourish the fitful dark-lantern apace,</p>
<p class="i2">And wield the gay crowbar in elegant style;</p>
<p>With skeleton-keys to pick counting-house locks,</p>
<p class="i2">To ply the dumb saw and the chisel that's cold,</p>
<p>To prize up the lid of a banker's strong-box,</p>
<p class="i2">And the portals of burglar-proof safes to unfold.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>When their Lordships were thoroughly versed in their trade,</p>
<p class="i2">And had passed their exams, in a masterly way,</p>
<p>They agreed that a dashing attempt should be made,</p>
<p class="i2">Their expertness to test without further delay.</p>
<p>Should they first try their hands at a light, easy job,</p>
<p class="i2">Not too risky, but graceful, artistic and neat,</p>
<p>Or essay a bold stroke the Exchequer to rob,</p>
<p class="i2">Or the merry Old Lady of Threadneedle Street?</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>At last they resolved that the best thing to do,</p>
<p class="i2">Was to try an experiment, just for a lark,</p>
<p>(And to keep their hands in for a lucrative <i>coup</i>,)</p>
<p class="i2">On a workman's abode near Victoria Park.</p>
<p>They hankered for something quite simple and plain,</p>
<p class="i2">Both suburban and poor, for their trial essay;</p>
<p>So they picked out a one-storeyed house down a lane,</p>
<p class="i2">Which they learned had been empty for many a day.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>They commenced their attack in the dead of the night,</p>
<p class="i2">Scaled a wall, dug a tunnel, and cut through two floors,</p>
<p>Wrenched a lock off with stern, irresistible might,</p>
<p class="i2">And broke open some thoroughly unsecured doors.</p>
<p>For booty they hunted below and on high&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">But naught could they find save a chunk of cold veal,</p>
<p>Till, down in the basement, they chanced to espy,</p>
<p class="i2">Near the back-kitchen sink a huge trapdoor of steel.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>In a second the trap from its fastness they tore,</p>
<p class="i2">When, heaped up pell-mell, of all shapes and all sizes,</p>
<p>The gratified Peers beheld score upon score</p>
<p class="i2">Of grand and legitimate housebreakers' prizes,&mdash;</p>
<p>Tiaras of rubies and diamond <i>rivières</i>,</p>
<p class="i2">Superb jewelled bracelets and brooches and rings,</p>
<p>Great emerald, sapphire, and pearl <i>solitaires</i>,</p>
<p class="i2">And all manner of precious, magnificent things.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>As they gazed on these treasures with glittering eyes,</p>
<p class="i2">Lightly handling the gewgaws with delicate touches,</p>
<p>The Duke softly murmured, "Oh! what a surprise!</p>
<p class="i2">Why, some of these trinkets belong to the Duchess!"</p>
<p>"By Jove!" said the Marquis, "this carcanet here</p>
<p class="i2">Has been worn scores of times by my dowager-aunt!"</p>
<p>And the Baron rejoined, "It seems perfectly clear</p>
<p class="i2">That this squalid abode is a regular plant!"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"What a joke!" cried the Earl. "We have chanced on the ken</p>
<p class="i2">Of professional brethren, our seniors in guile,</p>
<p>And I think that, for young inexperienced men,</p>
<p class="i2">We have collared their plunder in workmanlike style.</p>
<p>Let us cull and remove these nefarious hoards&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">We can turn the whole lot into cash at our leisure;</p>
<p>A delightful career is before us, my Lords,</p>
<p class="i2">A bright future of usefulness, profit, and pleasure!"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The next day they disposed of their swag for a plum,</p>
<p class="i2">And invested the proceeds in Spaniards and Turks,</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
